/**
 * Department Menu - Now using theme's hover-based dropdown system
 * 
 * This script is no longer needed since we're using the same hover-based
 * dropdown system as the main menu (like Administration, Sheriff, etc.)
 * 
 * The department menu now uses:
 * - Standard WordPress menu walker (no custom walker)
 * - CSS hover states for dropdowns (same as main menu)
 * - Down arrow indicators (â†“) like the main menu
 * - No custom toggle buttons or accordion JS
 */

// All custom accordion functionality has been removed
// The department menu now works exactly like the main navigation menu
